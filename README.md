# Features 🎉

The entire [portfolio](https://your-site-url.com/) is a React-based single-page app built with Next.js in TypeScript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ✍🏻

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images 🖼️

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames.

# ✨ Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/Developer-Portfolio.git
cd Developer-Portfolio/

# GITHUB_TOKEN is required for some parts
# See https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

npm i
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# 🚚 Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with their GitHub integration, where the `main` branch is automatically aliased to [your-site-url.com](https://your-site-url.com/). A link to a preview deployment will appear under each Pull Request.
