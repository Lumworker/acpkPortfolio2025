# Personal Developer Portfolio üöÄ

[![Site preview](/public/portfolio-thumbnail.png)](https://ibiimemon.com/)

Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), it not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance. View the [live site](https://your-site-url.com/).

# Features üéâ

The entire [portfolio](https://your-site-url.com/) is a React-based single-page app built with Next.js in TypeScript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ‚úçüèª

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images üñºÔ∏è

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames.

# ‚ú® Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/Developer-Portfolio.git
cd Developer-Portfolio/

# GITHUB_TOKEN is required for some parts

npm i
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# üöö Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with their GitHub integration, where the `main` branch is automatically aliased to [your-site-url.com](https://your-site-url.com/). A link to a preview deployment will appear under each Pull Request.
